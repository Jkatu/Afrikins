            <img src="images/teacher.webp" alt="Afrikins Team">
            Afrikins is a passionate collective of African storytellers, filmmakers, researchers, and cultural curators. 
            Our mission is to authentically document the diverse stories, histories, and contemporary realities of Africa 
            from an African perspective.
            <br><br>
            We believe that every community has a voice worth hearing, and every culture has a heritage worth preserving. 
            From rural villages to bustling cities, from oral traditions to cutting-edge innovations, we aim to create 
            films that educate, inspire, and connect people across the continent and beyond.

        <p>
            Our mission is to produce impactful documentaries that challenge stereotypes, preserve African heritage, 
            and celebrate the continent’s creativity and resilience. Our vision is an Africa whose stories are told 
            truthfully, respectfully, and globally — ensuring future generations inherit an unbroken chain of memory 
            and identity.
